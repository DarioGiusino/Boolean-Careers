# Folders

The folders contain the projects completed during the learning period at Boolean Careers, divided by programming language type. Chronologically, the academy saw the implementation of languages in the following order: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Plain, Vue.js, MySQL, PHP Plain, Laravel.

# Mid Project (VueJs)

This project represents the mid-path milestone in the academy, focusing on the skills acquired in front-end development with Vue.js. The folder contains an interactive e-commerce application, primarily built in Vue.js, integrating various crucial aspects of front-end development. The e-commerce provides an intuitive and responsive platform for selling various products.

The implementation of Vue.js ensures a dynamic and smooth user experience, allowing users to navigate through product categories, view details, add items to the cart, and complete purchases with ease. Efforts are focused on usability and interactivity, making the most of Vue.js features to efficiently manage user interface logic.

Additionally, the folder includes the use of various graphic utilities to enhance the visual appearance of the application. SCSS is used to modularly organize the site's style in a maintainable way, while Bootstrap integration ensures a responsive and consistent structure across different platforms. FontAwesome has been used for icon implementation, enriching the aesthetics and visual clarity of the e-commerce.

Overall, this mid-term project is an opportunity to demonstrate understanding and application of skills acquired in Vue.js, SCSS, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome, creating a responsive and functional e-commerce application.

# Final Project (VueJs, Laravel)

The project is a complex and comprehensive application that replicates the experience offered by the food delivery application Deliveroo. It uses a Laravel-based architecture for the backend and Vue for the frontend, allowing smooth communication between the two applications through microservices.

The "Final Project (Vue.js, Laravel)" folder represents the main development environment where this project was built within the Boolean Careers academy. The choice of Laravel for the backend provides solidity and flexibility in developing data management, request handling, and logical operations of the application. On the other hand, Vue.js was used to provide a responsive and intuitive user interface that allows users to interact smoothly with the application.

One of the crucial and distinctive aspects of this project is the implementation of the Braintree library. Braintree offers scalable and secure payment solutions that allow users to make financial transactions reliably and securely within the application. The integration of Braintree provides customers with the ability to make payments quickly and seamlessly, enhancing the overall user experience while using the application.

The microservices approach favors the scalability and maintainability of the application. This architecture divided into modules allows more effective management of the various functionalities of the application, also allowing updates and changes without negatively impacting the entire system.

In summary, the "Final Project (Vue.js, Laravel)" is an advanced application that replicates the experience of a food delivery service like Deliveroo. It leverages the modern architecture of Laravel and Vue.js, along with the implementation of Braintree to provide a smooth, secure, and functional user experience, while ensuring scalability and maintainability through the use of microservices.

The work was carried out with a team of 5 people.
